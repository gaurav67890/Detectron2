# Hyper-parameter tuning in GCP for Augmented dent dataset



### 1. All the steps from building docker and running gcp will remain same from feat/AICAR-325-hyperparameter-tuning-scratch branch

### 2. After each trial, along with the model and dict_dict.json file, we will be able to see the training loss plots inside our bucket in google storage.
